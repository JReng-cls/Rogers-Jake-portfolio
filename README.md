I am **Jake Rogers**, a 12th grade student in the Advanced Placement
Networking and Advanced Topics in Engineering programs at Charlotte Latin School. I am especially
interested in Mechanical Engineering. Outside of class, I participate in
Wrestling and Lacrosse. My favorite hobbies are Fishing and Work. In the
future, I hope to be a Mechanical Engineer.
