### Pomodoro Study Chair

For my Senior engineering capstone project I decided to build a pomodor study chair. The chair will be constructed of wood with a circuit in the arm of the chair that uses the pomodoro study method by keeping track of the study/break intervals. The chair will also encoporate a speaker to notify the user when they should switch from study to break or the other way around.

## Daily Journal

- Day 1: On day one I spent my time searching for ergonomic chair designs to influence my own. I decided on creating a relatively smaller chair to support my budget. I decided on making the chair out of two different kinds of wood. One type that is harder or sturdier for the side/legs of the chair for support, and another type for the backrest and seat of the chair
- Day 2: I began measuring a chair in the lab to begin desiging my chair in fusion360. I used a classroom chair as a model in order to use less material as the chair is smaller than usual.
- Day 3: Measuring and designing
- Day 4: Measuring and designing
- Day 5: Test cut finished file on cardboard(Scaled down)
- Day 6: Re-designed file based off of test cut
- Day 7: Test cut new file on Cardboard(Scaled down)
- Day 8: Test cut file on wood(To scale)
- Day 9: Re-designed file based off of test cut and created adobe file to test on cardboard
- Day 10: Test cut on cardboard to see new size. Added fillets to the fusion file for smoother look. Created aspire file with new design.
- Day 11: Adjusted fusion360 file to be taller and less wide. It was 52 inches in length and only 26 inches tall. The ideal height would be 36 inches tall so that I can place the seat at least 15 inches off the ground
- Day 12: Began working on creating the timer circuit with a Raspberry pi pico h and a LCD display. Using arduino IDE and a template on Wokwi I was able to display a "hello world" message
- Day 13: Using AI I was able to write the code that displayed a timer on the LCD display with a message "Time Studying:"
- Day 14: I switched from an LCD display to an OLED display for a better view of the timer. I used a 4 pin OLED and kept the Raspberry Pi pico. I also switched to thonny IDE from Arduino IDE as it supports more raspberry pi pico h libraries
- Day 15: I was able to create code that ran a stopwatch with the same "Study time:" above the stopwatch
- Day 16: I added the pomodoro piece to my code by making the OLED display a Study time for 15 seconds then switch to break time for 5 seconds. These are not the typical time increments for the pomodoro study method so that I could test quicker
- Day 17: I added a buzzer speaker to my circuit with just a power and ground pin. I adjusted my code so that the speaker buzzes in between intervals. 
- Day 18: Broke chair file down into pieces so that I could arrange them to be efficient during cuts. I decided that when I cut these pieces out with wood on the shoptbot that I will use domino inserts to hold the pieces together.
