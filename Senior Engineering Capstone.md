### Study Chair

For my senior engineering capstone project I decided to build a chair integrated with software that will keep track of the time you have been sitting in the chair as well as play music through wired speakers mounted on the chair. The purpose of the chair is for studying. The chair provides a timer to keep track of time spent studying as well as play music to help with your learning.

- Day 1: On day one I spent my time searching for ergonomic chair designs to influence my own. I decided on creating a relatively smaller chair to support my budget. I decided on making the chair out of two different kinds of wood. One type that is harder or sturdier for the side/legs of the chair for support, and another type for the backrest and seat of the chair
- Day 2: I began measuring a chair in the lab to begin desiging my chair in fusion360
