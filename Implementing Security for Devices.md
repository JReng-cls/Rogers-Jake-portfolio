## Password Algorithm Design Challenge

In this activity password algorithms were created for a user trying to secure a device or application. 

Chosen Algorithm: 
- Users birth month+Users birth day+ Users birth year
- Least favorite snack
- Random Symbol
- All even numbers from users phone number
- All odd numbers from users phone number added to
- Random lowercase letter
- Random uppercase letter
- Random uppercase letter
- Random symbol

  ex: 2040spinach#1833pOL&

This password algorithm would suffice for the creation of a unique secure password. The algorithm uses a mix or symbols, numbers, and letters as well as very lengthy. A user would need to have a password manager in order to use this algorthim as it is not easy to remember.

This information came from the Password Algortim Design Challenge
