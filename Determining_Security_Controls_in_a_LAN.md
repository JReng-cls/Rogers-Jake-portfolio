## Determining Security Controls in a LAN

Which device inside a LAN would be the easiest for an attacker to compromise, and why?
Does proximity equal safety? How much can a device ‘see’ inside a LAN?

Endpoint devices would be the easiest for an attacker to compromise because usually these devices become vulnerable due to user error. Proximity can mean safety but not always, in a buisness enviorment network equipment might me locked up so the closer to that the more secure it can be. However, in other network settings, most of the security measures are established on the router and applied to all devices such as a firewall or ICMP block. A device can "see" inside a LAN by running commands such as 'ipconfig' which can show the user the running configuration.

The groups most confident hypotheses was the MAC address flooding. This is due to the lack of reasons for thousands of MAC addresses to appear on one port on a switch. The scenario that was hardest to interpret was the broadcast domain scenario. However, once a group member suggested that open ports could be abused to broadcast phishing attacks on the network the scenario became easy. Talking with another pair helped us to realize the amount of possibilities that could result in each scenario. A particular pattern noticed was that all of the situations resulted in hackers taking advantage of vulnerabilities revealed by user error.
