# Switch Security


In a LAN, the easiest devices to attack are endpoint devices as these devices security measures and procedures are left to the user. In a buisness enviorment, it is the employees job to not leave a laptop opened and unattended with sensitive information available to anyone who walks by. Devices inside the network are more dangerous as they can be used to communicate with other devices within the same VLAN and potentially attack the network using its communication abilities. A typical device can view all non-privaledged information on its own VLAN. This is typically the entire VLAN as companies separate privaledge levels by VLAN.
