### Determining Security Controls for Devices

These projects and activities show the different ways that computers secure sensitive data and how computer users can maintain proper device securitization.

## Cybersecurity Basics for Devices

Most attacks upon networks are due to user error. Devices are access points into a network and once a hacker is inside they can reach all unsecure data within that network. It is important to keep devices secure especially in a proffesional enviorment where lost data can cost thousands. 
In order to properly maintain device securitization, it is important to follow the CIA Triad

- Confidentiality: Ensuring that sensitive data is only accessed by individuals with authorization

- Integrity: Ensuring that the information/data un-corrupted, accurate, and trustworth. Ensure that your data hasn't been tampered with on purpose or by accident

- Availability: Making sure that information and systems are accesible to authorized users

Common Device Weaknesses:

- Outdated applications or operating systems: It is important to keep your
