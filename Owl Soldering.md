In this project we soldered LEDs and other components to re learn how to correctly solder.

During this project I managed to fry the first board. I learned that in order to prevent actions like this I need to thoroughly review my work before plugging it in. Plugging in the board with a birdge or a bad pad coulf lead to frying the chip. After slowing down and soldering correctly the second time I got the owl to light up.
