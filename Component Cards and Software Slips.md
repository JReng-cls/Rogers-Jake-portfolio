# Component Cards and Software Slips
In this assignment we learned the different hardware and software components of computers as well as how each of these parts interact with each other. We did various activities to help visualize this flow of data throughout computers.

## Silent Signals
Our first task was called "Silent Signals". In this task, a partner and I were told to answer a series of questions using a card with a blue side and a white side. We were only allowed to use that card for each of the questions.

My partner and I found that for yes or no questions we could just flip to one side of the card. Other questions required numerical values so for those we tapped the card on the table 

## Hardware
CPU(Central Processing Unit)-The "Brain" of the computer. Executes instructions from programs, performing calculations, logic, and decision making.

RAM(Random Access Memory)- The computers short term memory. Only runs while the computer is powered on, RAM is wiped when the computer shuts off

Storage- The computers long term data storage

GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)- processor for graphics, images and video

Motherboard- Serves as the connection between all the hardware within the pc

PSU(Power supply Unit)- Delivers power to the components of the pc

NIC(Network interface Card)- Conects your pc to the internet

Cooling System- Prevents the hardware components from getting to hot

Input/Output devices- The tools the user uses to interact with the computer

## Hardware Card Arrangment 
In order to fully understand the hardware components of computers we used cards to map out the flow of data throughout each component

I began with input/output devices thinking that the data transfer would start with the user on the keyboard and/or mouse. Next is the motherboard because all of the devices are connected to the motherboard. Following that I put CPU because that does all of the thinking and commands the computer what to do. The RAM stores the current actions so whatever the user just did. After that I put storage because the file is saved to the harddrive. Finnaly the GPU renders the graphics and pushes them out to your monitor/output device. I chose not to inclue the NIC as the specific instructions were for someone typing on a microsoft word doc and a netwrok connection is not necessary for that. The PSU and colling system I also left out of the data flow because they just keep the computer running they are not involved in the data transfer.

## PC Partner Challenge
Next we got into pairs and were given a $1,000 budget to build a pc for a specific purpose. My partner and I chose gaming.

My partner and I decided on the most exspensive CPU in order to maximize game efficiency and speed. We opted for 16GBs of RAM as a pc for gaming purposes does not need more RAM unless you are playing more than one game at a time or have streaming applications open. We only bought 512 GB of storage as most of the storage on a gaming pc would be taken up by games and you don't need that many games. We upgraded the GPU for smoother graphics. Finnaly we upgraded our NIC for better connection and reduced latency.

## Software

UEFI-Unified extensible firmware interface

OS- Operating system

JVM- Java virtual Machine

CLR- Common language runtime

## Software Chart
For our software activity my partner and I had to map out the data tranfer between software components of a pc

## Conclusion
This project helped me visualize the various ways computers run. Different components work together simultaneously to perform various tasks. Hardware components are all connected through the motherboard all doing different things for one common goal. Silent signals was difficult at first to come to an understanding with my partner of what each action meant, however, after the first few questions we came to a non-verbal understanding. The Hardware cardslips were also difficult at first but after thinking through the jobs of each component, you can find the order. The PC activity helped me understand that its not necessary to buy the best component for every component to fit your needs. Finnaly the software chart helped me visualize how the data is transfered within the computer.
