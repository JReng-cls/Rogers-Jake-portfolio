# Component Cards and Software Slips
In this assignment we learned the different hardware and software components of computers.
## Hardware
CPU(Central Processing Unit)-The "Brain" of the computer. Executes instructions from programs, performing calculations, logic, and decision making.
RAM(Random Access Memory)- The computers short term memory. Only runs while the computer is powered on, RAM is wiped when the computer shuts off
Storage- The computers long term data storage
GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)- processor for graphics, images and video
Motherboard- Serves as the connection between all the hardware within the pc
PSU(Power supply Unit)- Delivers power to the components of the pc
NIC(Network interface Card)- Conects your pc to the internet
Cooling System- Prevents the hardware components from getting to hot
Input/Output devices- The tools the user uses to interact with the computer
## Hardware Card Arrangment 
In order to fully understand the hardware components of computers we used cards to map out the flow of data throughout each component

Next we got into pairs and were given a $1,000 budget to build a pc for a specific purpose. My partner and I chose gaming. We focused on a good processor for smooth gameplay as well as a good GPU for graphics and render distance.

## Software
UEFI-Unified extensible firmware interface
OS- Operating system
JVM- Java virtual Machine
CLR- Common language runtime
For our software activity my partner and I had to map out the data tranfer between software components of a pc

## Conclusion
This project helped me visualize the various ways computers run. Different components work together simultaneously to perform various tasks.
